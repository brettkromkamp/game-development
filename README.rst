Game Development-related Code and Algorithms by Brett Kromkamp
==============================================================

As the title implies, this repo is (will be) a collection of code snippets and algorithms that are especially relevant for game development. The first set of commits are related to (2D) vectors, an understanding of which is critical for game development. Areas to explore also include graph (for example, Dijkstra and A*) and probability-related algorithms.
